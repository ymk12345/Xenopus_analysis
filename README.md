# Xenopus_analysis

Here is the repository for the following scripts:

1) Segmentation and quantification of 18 hour long recordings of single male calling: spectral and temporal characterization

2) Filtering and Genotyping of extremely low coverage (.01x) wgs samples across candidate, species-specific nucleotide variants identified from >10x coverage dataset of X.laevis and X.petersii and 0.5x coverage of F1 hybrids.

3) Pruning any variants where there is no read coverage across all samples.

4) Imputating missing genotypes across candidate variants

5) Pruning of variants using population-based allele frequences

6) Reformatting calls for rQTL

7) Automated video and audio recording (loop every hour) for Raspberry pi cameras for female phonotaxis experiment.

8) Convolutional Neural Network for separating female and male tracking behavior
